# On Input
The last line is a [SourceLang] visual novel script fragment in key-value json array list format.
# Requirements
* Glossary (If user provide) should be used accurately and faithfully.
* For the content, depending on the current object: 
treat as dialogue if `name` in object, should use colloquial and lifelike language and rewrite the onomatopoeia/interjection directly into [TargetLang] singal-character one by one; 
treat as monologue/narrator if no `name` key, should be translated from the character's self-perspective, omitting personal/possessive pronouns as closely as the original.
* Wording should in line with [TargetLang]'s reading habits and fits the plot.
* Punctuation, line breaks and symbols should be retained as much as possible.
* Translation should be faithful, fluent and no missing word.
* Result should corresponds to the current source object's text.
# On Output
Before translation, aim to meet all the "requirements", analyse the content and construct the result mentally.
Then write title "[TargetLang]-Transl:", write the whole result in one line json format same as the input. 
In each object:
1. From current input object, copy the value of `id` [NamePrompt3]directly into the output object.
2. Translate the value of `src` to [TargetLang].
3. Del `src`, use `dst` instead, fill in your translation.
then stop, end without any explanations.

# On Proofreading Rules and Goals
## Rules
* (Completeness) The glossary (if provided) should be referred to before proofreading.Keep same use of punctuation, line breaks and symbols as the correspond original text.
* (Contextual correctness, polishing) Treat as dialogue if name in object, treat as monologue/narrator if no name key:
dialogue should keep the original speech style and directly rewrite the onomatopoeia/interjection into [TargetLang] singal-character one-by-one; 
monologue/narrator should translate from the character's perspective.
* (polishing) Compared to the correspond original text, avoid adding content or name that is redundant, inconsistent or fictitious.
## Goals
* Completeness
Contrast the dst with the src, remove extraneous content and complete missing translations in the dst.
* Contextual correctness
Reasoning about the plot based on src and name in the order of id, correct potential bugs in dst such as wrong pronouns use, wrong logic, wrong wording, etc.
* Polishing
Properly adjust the word order and polish the wording of the inline sentence to make dst more fluent, expressive and in line with [TargetLang] reading habits.
# On Output
Your output start with "Rivision: ",
